    <h1>MAKAIS BLOG</h1>

    <p>The business that I want to create is a tree planting business. I am very passionate about hiking and it seems like I could start a business planting trees where I hike. It also is something that I feel comfortable enough to make sure that the customer is purchasing something of value. As for the actual creation of the business it feels like something I could create and have working in a usable state as all I need to do is set up a payment system online. It would consist of different types of trees. I'm thinking of planting seeds for $1-$4.99 and then an actual tree for however much they cost at home depot or a gardening store so probably $20-$40. I also think I can label the business as non profit for gas and hiking supplies and such so I can get paid to do my hobby.

    <h1> Week 3 assignment post </h1>

    <p>This week's lessons on shipping and the differences between drop shipping and affiliate shipping was an interesting concept to learn about. I don't believe that my business is going to use shipping besides maybe to myself to plant the trees but it is still an interesting concept as I may branch out and ship out something for my business in the future. As for the business itself I have brainstormed some ideas. I want to offer multiple levels of purchases ranging from 1$ to 40$ all involving trees that can be planted. I will do this by hand up in an undecided location but Utah's dry canyon area looks promising. I have researched how to plant a pre grown tree and for the other cheaper options I will do service such as watering or planting just a seed. I am actively looking forward to working on this business in the future.</p>

    <h1> Week 4 assignment post</h1>

    <p>This week I am looking at different hosts to hold my website. I am mainly looking at github and cloudflare to host as they are the most price friendly being both free. I have used github in the past and I think I want to use it for the project but also kind of want to try cloudflare as I can have an actual .com site up and that sounds pretty cool. There are also a lot of things I need to learn about cloudflare like how to actually post my code onto it and be able to make sure everything works. I also don't know about the security of both of them and want to research them both and see if they are a reliable place to put my money into. It was a busy week with a lot of assignments but I hope that they will be more business focused so I can focus on the business.</p>

  <h1> Week 6 assignment post</h1>

    <p>This week I made my business. it can be found at a weird url that I don't want to link here but will eventually. It contains a logo and a quick description saying: Welcome to Jar Tree
Jar Tree is a "Registering" Non profit that plans to plants trees across Utah and hopefully the world, Please consider purchasing or donating TODAY. It also includes a bunch of other stuff like the ability to buy poplar seeds and cedar seeds and even a whole tree to plant in Utah. The other day I applied as a DBA and am trying to get into the NON PROFIT business. There is still some stuff I want to add to my site but other than that I feel like I did a lot. I am scared about the google ads campaign as there is a lot of stuff that talks about how you need to be carefull or else you will spend thousands of dollars accidentally.

    <h1>Week 10 assignment post</h1>

    <p>This week we learned about keywords and did our project 3. We also did an assignment that let us look at how to get data from our keywords as well as see the conversion rate, clicks, impressions it had, average cost per click, and conversion rate. We also tried to focus our keywords more. We also learned about ROI conversion. The ROI conversion I am going to use for my website is measuring the profits on the sales that I make. A standard tree costs $35.99 at home depot and $19.99 at costco. Both are available in my store for sale at a price of $39.99. I also have standard tree seeds for $0.99 cents that I plant which are bought off amazon for an average of $9.99 for 50 seeds. This makes the conversion module for the following trees listed below
S = Products Sold
B = Product Bought
Home Depot Tree
(S(39.99) - (B(35.99) + 50.00))/(35.99 + 50.00) = Total Profit
Costco Tree
(S(39.99) - (B(19.99) + 50.00))/(19.99 + 50.00) = Total Profit
Amazon Tree
(S(0.99) - (B(0.05) + 50.00))/(0.05 + 50.00) = Total Profit
These will determine my total gross profit. There are other thins such as gas, car payments, car registration, taxes and others that are not calculated that I need to keep this business running but other than that it is a gross estimate. Another Roi Conversion tracking I want to put is a “TOTAL TREES PLANTED” and I want to show that on my site.</p>
