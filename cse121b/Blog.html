    <p>The business that I want to create is a tree planting business. I am very passionate about hiking and it seems like I could start a business planting trees where I hike. It also is something that I feel comfortable enough to make sure that the customer is purchasing something of value. As for the actual creation of the business it feels like something I could create and have working in a usable state as all I need to do is set up a payment system online. It would consist of different types of trees. I'm thinking of planting seeds for $1-$4.99 and then an actual tree for however much they cost at home depot or a gardening store so probably $20-$40. I also think I can label the business as non profit for gas and hiking supplies and such so I can get paid to do my hobby.

    <h1> Week 3 assignment post </h1>

    <p>This week's lessons on shipping and the differences between drop shipping and affiliate shipping was an interesting concept to learn about. I don't believe that my business is going to use shipping besides maybe to myself to plant the trees but it is still an interesting concept as I may branch out and ship out something for my business in the future. As for the business itself I have brainstormed some ideas. I want to offer multiple levels of purchases ranging from 1$ to 40$ all involving trees that can be planted. I will do this by hand up in an undecided location but Utah's dry canyon area looks promising. I have researched how to plant a pre grown tree and for the other cheaper options I will do service such as watering or planting just a seed. I am actively looking forward to working on this business in the future.</p>

    <h1> Week 4 assignment post</h1>

    <p>This week I am looking at different hosts to hold my website. I am mainly looking at github and cloudflare to host as they are the most price friendly being both free. I have used github in the past and I think I want to use it for the project but also kind of want to try cloudflare as I can have an actual .com site up and that sounds pretty cool. There are also a lot of things I need to learn about cloudflare like how to actually post my code onto it and be able to make sure everything works. I also don't know about the security of both of them and want to research them both and see if they are a reliable place to put my money into. It was a busy week with a lot of assignments but I hope that they will be more business focused so I can focus on the business.</p>

    <h1> Week 5 assignment post</h1>

    <p>This week we worked a lot with pay pal. It was a very difficult experience getting the button to work. I also worked a lot on the website itself. It doesnt look too good design wise so I think im going to try and fix the css over the week next week. There is also a lot to do to make sure I am ready to run the business over time. I want to be prepared but there is just a lot to do. We also had a lot of group discussions this week and worked on paypal as well. My buisness is still going to be a tree planting service but I just need to work out cloudflare or github so I can accept payments for the trees. After that I want to focus on google ads and make sure that my website is not going to break my budget.</p>
