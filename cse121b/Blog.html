    <p>The business that I want to create is a tree planting business. I am very passionate about hiking and it seems like I could start a business planting trees where I hike. It also is something that I feel comfortable enough to make sure that the customer is purchasing something of value. As for the actual creation of the business it feels like something I could create and have working in a usable state as all I need to do is set up a payment system online. It would consist of different types of trees. I'm thinking of planting seeds for $1-$4.99 and then an actual tree for however much they cost at home depot or a gardening store so probably $20-$40. I also think I can label the business as non profit for gas and hiking supplies and such so I can get paid to do my hobby.
