    <p>The business that I want to create is a tree planting business. I am very passionate about hiking and it seems like I could start a business planting trees where I hike. It also is something that I feel comfortable enough to make sure that the customer is purchasing something of value. As for the actual creation of the business it feels like something I could create and have working in a usable state as all I need to do is set up a payment system online. It would consist of different types of trees. I'm thinking of planting seeds for $1-$4.99 and then an actual tree for however much they cost at home depot or a gardening store so probably $20-$40. I also think I can label the business as non profit for gas and hiking supplies and such so I can get paid to do my hobby.

    <h1> Week 3 assignment post </h1>

    <p>This week's lessons on shipping and the differences between drop shipping and affiliate shipping was an interesting concept to learn about. I don't believe that my business is going to use shipping besides maybe to myself to plant the trees but it is still an interesting concept as I may branch out and ship out something for my business in the future. As for the business itself I have brainstormed some ideas. I want to offer multiple levels of purchases ranging from 1$ to 40$ all involving trees that can be planted. I will do this by hand up in an undecided location but Utah's dry canyon area looks promising. I have researched how to plant a pre grown tree and for the other cheaper options I will do service such as watering or planting just a seed. I am actively looking forward to working on this business in the future.</p>
